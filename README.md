## Accessing the Application
Once the application is running, you can access it via:

### Option 1: Using localhost (Default)

- Frontend: http://localhost
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080

### Option 2: Using Custom Domain (Recommended)
Edit the /etc/hosts file to set up a custom domain:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
sudo nano /etc/hosts

# Windows
# Run Notepad as Administrator and open C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
